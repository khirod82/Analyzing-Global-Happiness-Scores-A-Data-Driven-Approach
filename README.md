The analysis likely reveals that GDP per capita and social support have the most significant impact on happiness, suggesting that economic prosperity and strong community networks enhance well-being. Countries with high levels of corruption and limited personal freedoms tend to have lower happiness scores, indicating that good governance and individual autonomy play crucial roles. Interestingly, some nations may have high GDP but lower happiness, highlighting that economic growth alone does not guarantee well-being; factors like mental health, work-life balance, and social inclusivity are equally important. The model can help policymakers identify areas for improvement, guiding strategies to enhance national happiness and quality of life.
